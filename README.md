# KD-LO
KAN-Based Denoising for LiDAR Odometry in High-Reflection Environments

To implement the chemical robot localization algorithm incorporating KAN-based denoising in high-reflectivity environments, Ubuntu 20.04 was selected as the operating system, providing a stable and widely supported development environment. In terms of programming languages, C++ was primarily used for the efficient implementation of core algorithms, while Python 3.8 was employed for data processing and deep learning model training. The Robot Operating System (ROS1) was used as the communication and control framework.
